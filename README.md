* `Fireflow` is an open source, easy and rapid development tool to build apps like social network service, forum based community service, online shopping service, and much more.

* `Fireflow` is especially designed to work with `FlutterFlow`.

# Features

- Enhanced user management.
  - The documents of the `/users` collection have private information and shouldn't be disclosed. But the user information is needed to be disclosed for the most app features. To make it happen, I created another collection named `/users_public_data` that does not hold user's prviate informatio.

- Enhanced chat.
  - Custom design
    - Custom design means, adding buttons for edit and delete.

- Complete forum functionality including;
  - Category management

  - Post and comment management including
    - Nested (threaded) comments
  - Push notification
    - Subscribing/Unsubscribing a category
    - Sending push notifications to the author of the parent comments and post.

# Getting started

The fireflow has lots of features and lots of documentation. To make it easy to maintain, I have wrote a separate document.

Please see the [Fireflow official document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQXcu36d1ojHEoi1lh3UNKXnDrfRtb_7J4j7GmTsc1eS2LdLMoggA2KfMqGpE3L4PaYNmCHDhGn6SEm/pub)
