# Fireflow

`Fireflow` is an open source, easy, and rapid development tool for FlutterFlow apps providing more powerful and enhanced features like chat, forum, push notifications, and social community features.

# Features

- Enhanced user management.
  - The documents of the `/users` collection have private information and shouldn't be disclosed. But the user information is needed to be disclosed for the most app features. To make it happen, I created another collection named `/users_public_data` that does not hold user's prviate informatio.

- Enhanced chat.
  - Custom design
    - Custom design means, adding buttons for edit and delete.

- Complete forum functionality including;
  - Category management
  - User role management
  - Post and comment management including
    - Nested (threaded) comments
  - Push notification
    - Subscribing/Unsubscribing a category
    - Sending push notifications to the author of the parent comments and post.
