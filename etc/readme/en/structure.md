# The structure of Fireflow

The fireflow reuses the code of the flutterflow since fireflow depends on flutterflow. But fireflow is decoupled from flutterflow. This means you can use fireflow with flutter.

## Files and folders

- `lib/src/actions`
  This folder contains codes that works like functions but depending on Firebase or Material design.

- `lib/src/functions`
  This folder contains codes that are independent from Firebase, nor Material design.

- `lib/src/widgets`
  This folder contains widgets.
