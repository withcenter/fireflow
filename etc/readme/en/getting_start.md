## Setting up Firebase

### Firestore Security Rules

Fireflow has its own Firestore Security Rules to protect the app safer.

You may think `App check` will do for the security. Partly, yes. While `App Check` adds an important layer of protection against some (not all) abuse towards your backend, it does not replace Firebase's server-side security rules. See [the App Check offical document](https://firebase.google.com/docs/app-check#how_strong_is_the_security_provided_by).

1. To apply it, you will need to check the `Exclude` buttons on the Collections in `Firestore Rules` section of FlutterFlow.

2. And copy the [fireflow security rules](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/withcenter/fireflow/main/firebase/firestore.rules) and paste it into your Firebase firestore security rules.

## Enable deeplink

- Enable the Deeplink in FlutterFlow.

## Enable Supabase

- Enable supabase even if you are not using it.
- See the [known issues](https://github.com/withcenter/fireflow/blob/main/etc/readme/flutterflow/en/known-issue.md#supabase-and-rxdart)
## AppService

- `AppService` will serve with the core services of fireflow through the lifecyle of the app. You can initialize like below.

```dart
import 'package:fireflow/fireflow.dart';

Future appService(BuildContext context) async {
  // Add your function code here!
  AppService.instance.init(
    context: context,
  );
}
```


_ If you would like to use `Supabase` for full text search and push notification, you may set more options like below.


```dart

import 'package:fireflow/fireflow.dart';
import 'package:go_router/go_router.dart';

Future appService(BuildContext context) async {
  // Add your function code here!
  print('appService()');

  AppService.instance.init(
    context: context,
    debug: true,
    supabase: SupabaseOptions(
      usersPublicData: 'users_public_data',
      posts: 'posts',
      comments: 'comments',
      postsAndComments: 'posts_and_comments',
    ),
    messaging: MessagingOptions(
      foreground: true,
      background: false,
      onTap: (String initialPageName, Map<String, String> parameterData) {
        dog('on message tap: $initialPageName, Map<String, String> $parameterData');
        context.pushNamed(initialPageName, queryParams: parameterData);
      },
    ),
  );
}

```

To see the details, refer the document of [AppService.init](https://pub.dev/documentation/fireflow/latest/fireflow/AppService/init.html)

As you can see, it uses the `push_notifications_handler.dart` that is generated by Fluterflow. So, you need to check `Exclude from compilation`.

The `onTapMessage` is the push notification handler while the app is foreground. And If you don't want it, you can remove that part including `import .../push_notifications_handler.dart;` And uncheck the `Exclude from compilation`.

- There are some functions, widgets and actions that don't need to connect to Firebase and don't need to use BuildContext. They are called as **Independent Components**.
  - For `Independent Components`, you don't have to initialize the `AppService`.
  - I should have decoupled the Independent Components, but I didn't for hoping that people who need the `Independent Components` would get interested in fireflow.


- Add the `appService` action on the root level screens.
  - One thing to note is that, the context that is given to `AppService` must be valid context. You may initialize the `AppService` on all the root level screens to provide valid context.
  - The root level screen is the screens that are the at bottom parts of the nav stack and the context of the screens must alive.
    - For instance, If the Home screen is always exists at the bottom of the nav stack, then you can only add the `appService` action on Home screen.
  - If you really don't know what to do, you can simply add the action on every page.

- If `debug` is set to true, then it prints the debug message to console.
- If `displayError` is set to true, then it display error messages as snackbar.


## Authentication

- You may enable `Email/Password` in Firestore authentication section for email and password login.


- For authentication, you need to
  - update **users** schema (See [the users section](https://github.com/withcenter/fireflow/blob/main/etc/readme/flutterflow/en/user.md))
  - create **users_public_data** schema (See [the users section](https://github.com/withcenter/fireflow/blob/main/etc/readme/flutterflow/en/user.md))
  - create **user_setting** schema. (See [the user session section](https://github.com/withcenter/fireflow/blob/main/etc/readme/flutterflow/en/user_setting.md))




## Enable Push notification for Phone Signin

- Enable push notification in FlutterFlow if your app is going to use Phone sign-in in iOS.



## Local State Variable

Note that, these local state variables may be changed based on your app logic.
 

![Image Link](https://github.com/withcenter/fireflow/blob/main/etc/readme/img/ff-local-states-2.jpg?v=2&raw=true "Local State Variables")

- `defaultImagePath` is the image path that will be used by default. For instance, when you add a Image widget and sometimes it needs the default image.
- `anonymousMaleUrl` is the male picture url that will be shown by default when the user is male and has no profile photo.
- `anonymousFemaleUrl` is the female picture url that will be used when the user is female and has no profile photo.
- `chatSendMessageAskResult` is the state that will hold the result of chat send option. When the user sends a message, he can choose an option whether to query to GPT or not.
- `gptLoader` is the state that when the user query to GPT, it will show the loading indicator.
- `anonymousEmail` is used for guest login.
- `anonymousPassword` is used for guest password. It's okay that the guest password is revealed to the public. Anonyone can login anyway.
- `isGuest` is needed to be set to true on home screen if the user signed in as guest.
- `tempStringArray` is for temporarily saving a string array. For instance, when a user uploads multiple files/photos, the app can save those urls into this temporary string array.
- `setState` is for updating the state.





## Keys

- Some keys like the `Open AI` key can't be exposed to public. Once it did, it will be automatically invalid. So, you need to keep it secret. In this manner, Fireflow keeps the keys in Firestore database.


### Open AI Keys

- Save the Open AI Keys at `/system_settings/keys {openAiApiKey: ... }`.
